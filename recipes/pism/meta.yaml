# Note: there are many handy hints in comments in this example -- remove them when you've finalized your recipe
# If your package is python based, we recommend using Grayskull to generate it instead:
# https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull

# Jinja variables help maintain the recipe as you'll update the version only here.
# Using the name variable with the URL in line 16 is convenient
# when copying and pasting from another recipe, but not really needed.

source:
  # If getting the source from GitHub, remove the line above,
  # uncomment the line below, and modify as needed. Use releases if available:
  url: https://github.com/pism/pism/archive/v{{ version }}.tar.gz
  # sha256: 9d7e9854b58180df58d38fdd3eaa993a1e247548dfe183a8753a3f15190b6aaa
  # sha256 is the preferred checksum -- you can get it for a file with:
  #  `openssl sha256 <file name>`.
  # You may need the openssl package, available on conda-forge:
  #  `conda install openssl -c conda-forge``

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  # More info about selectors can be found in the conda-build docs: 
  # https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#preprocessing-selectors

  summary: 'PISM, a Parallel Ice Sheet Model'
  description: |
    The Parallel Ice Sheet Model is an open source, parallel, high-resolution ice sheet model:
      - hierarchy of available stress balances
      - marine ice sheet physics, dynamic calving fronts
      - polythermal, enthalpy-based conservation of energy scheme
      - extensible coupling to atmospheric and ocean models
      - verification and validation tools
      - `documentation <pism-manual_>`_ for users and developers
      - uses MPI_ and PETSc_ for parallel simulations
      - reads and writes `CF-compliant <cf_>`_  NetCDF_ files
